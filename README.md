# DomeBot
My Arduino powered Greenhouse Automation System.

## About
Due to the new build of a 25 sqm Geodome (check out Paul Robinsons projects https://geo-dome.co.uk/article.asp?uname=portfolio) 
I wanted to automate as much as possible.

Right now the Project is based on an Arduino Mega 2560 and uses/will use some of the following hardware:
  - 2.8" Touch Screen
  - DHT11 Sensor for Temp and Humidity
  - 4 28byj-48 12v Stepper Motors for diy automatic window openers 
  - 12v water pump with 800l/h flow rate
  - Anemometer
  - 8-relay switch
  - solenoid valves for water distribution
  - data logger
  
  
The proof of concept is already done and wired, quite a lot of hardware is built, but I am still missing the complete GUI Menu for the Touch screen.
